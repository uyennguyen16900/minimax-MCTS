# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

XOX is an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game with a reliable Artificial Intelligence using the Minimax algorithm. It will choose the move with maximum score when it is the AI's turn and choose the move with the minimum score when it is the human player's turn. Using this strategy, Minimax avoids losing to the human player.

### Minimax Algorithm

Minimax is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player assuming that the other player is also playing optimally. It's widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Mancala, Go, etc.
